[tl;dr][2]


The Cloud, Cloud, Cloud presentation includes "four" sections.

### IoT items
Some IoT items including a dash for ordering toilet paper are passed around.
There is also an echo dot, connected up.
The presentation is started off with some interaction with [Alexa][1] via the echo dot.
(I forgot these items at home, so this part was left out of the *LJC Unconference* presentation.)


### slides
[slides][2]


The second part of the presentation involves going through the slides in an interactive way with the audience.
By the end of the slides everyone in the room should be completely clear on what the 'cloud' is, why it is called the 'cloud' and
aware that it is changing the way we work and the world around us.


### Exploration
[AWS][3], [Azure][4], [Blue Mix][5] and [Google Cloud Platform][6] and go on a a bit of tour through them showing some of the stuff I have put in the cloud.
I call out Amazon Lamda, and server less architecture and show the Lamda function for an Alexa skill I have written and then show it on Alexa and the Echo.


### Conclusion
I conclude with questions and discussion. If the interactivity that has been encouraged throughout the presentation has succeeded this piece is quite fun.
And then I finish off with asking Alexa "What is the cloud?"

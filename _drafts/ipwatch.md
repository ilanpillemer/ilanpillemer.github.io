# a little watcher for myself

something which is nice is to be able to set a watcher in a directory with 
some kind of instruction on what to do, if a file is changed in that directory.

this is a solved problem in general for example...

* [watchman (source code)](https://github.com/facebook/watchman "watchman by facebook")
* [watchman (documentation)](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/ "watchman by facebook")
* [golang (experimental) - not covered by any compability promises](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify)

I want to learn how to do this myself in golang.

1. It will teach me more about darwin and linux.
2. It will teach me more about golang.
3. I may wish to present on how to do this, to teach others the above at meetups or conferences.

This is my thoughts on that...

# Acme and Me

After trying several different ways of installing plan9port, eventually
realised that the best way is to fork the repo, pull and and follow install instructions.

The reasons are as follows

1. The homebrew version installs a version that is full of bugs and
   you have add a switch to build the latest from head anyway.
2. Although I understand the need for a minimal key-board shortcuts, I
   for one need to be able to go up and down one line without having
   to reach for the mouse. This means being able to patch the code.
3. The way homebrew installs it is not aligned with most of the tooling 
   built by others and then things don't work without fidgeting.   
   
   
# various changes to profile environment
```
	PLAN9=/Users/ilanpillemer/git/plan9port export PLAN9
	PATH=$PATH:$PLAN9/bin export PATH
```

#### notes to self

### Consider

Moving git repo appropriately and installing again at
    /usr/local/plan9

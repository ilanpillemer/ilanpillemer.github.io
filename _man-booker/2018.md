title: Man Booker 2018 (and me)
layout: page
---
I have decided as part of my new year introspection to read the [Man
Booker
shortlist](https://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/news/man-booker-prize-announces-2018-shortlist)
before the final award is announced Tuesday 16 October in Londonâ€™s
Guildhall. This gives me about 3 weeks to read through and reach my
opinions and thoughts before watching the live announcement on the
BBC.

At the same time I will be travelling, so the reading will occur in
London, Santa Clara (San Francisco) and Johannesburg (South Africa).

In order to help me form my thoughts and understand the experience of
engaging with these works over the next few weeks, I will be writing
down and editing those words that I have written as I go along. So if
you are interested in travelling this journey with me bookmark this
page and pop in over the next few weeks. I am expecting that I will
construct something that is part review, part travelogue and part
introspective.

# Everything Under

I read through *Everything Under* in four distinct moments of reading.


I read Chapter One the evening before the flight from Gatwick, London
to Oakland, California. I was sitting in my home in North West London
in the late evening. My family was sleeping in the house. I read the
first chapter slowly and reread and reread... to get a feel, a taste,
a sense, for the novel. A clear strong voice telling me about the
predetermination of the spaces of your minds came through. She was
asking me to think about the nature of my thoughts as being the
manifestation of the already. It was an uncanny feeling. A fate that
determines every act and choice you make, undermining those acts and
choices - and is never your friend.

I fell asleep relentlessly comparing this uncanny fate, with the human
being as witnesses of the river's stories; against that of Moses and
Israel standing in front of the River Jordan with Nature as the
witness. The two stories winded their ways across each other through
my dreams. The one in which every moment is a choice that determines
the universe as its reflection; and the other in which every moment,
evey choice is a reflection of a bewildering, unkind fate.

I read a few more chapters in a departure lounge at Gatwick, waiting
for the flight. I got slowly into the story, though having a brash
Salesman on the phone sitting next to me was a difficult distraction
to overcome. But I started feeling Gretel's hunt for meaning along the
river; trying to follow the crumbs home. I drank whiskey.

Once seated on the plane, I read a few more chapters getting a third
of the way through the work before my eyes started getting tired. I
had an elderly lady sitting next to me. We chatted. I then had a nap
on the plane for about two and a half hours. After that I read the
rest of novel in one long read (with noise cancelling headphones), in
which I became entranced in this story lost in an England that I never
knew existed. An England of locks and rivers and canals and a river
people. The story at moments had me completely in its thrall. I lost
myself in parts, submerged in the words.

I will start on *The Overstory* either tonight, or tomorrow. I am far
away now, about to fall asleep somewhere in San Jose. And I have been
awake for over 24 hours.

# The Overstory

Time passes through this book at a different pace. I am working in
another land with different trees to what I am a familiar. Finding
moments to read is not as easy as I would like, but I am ninety pages
into the novel, in which each chapter so far has journeyed through
generations of different diverse families as their stories pass
alongside another story, a slower story, and so far all the stories,
whether slow or fast or under or over, have been sad but tremendously
beautiful.

I am loving the book and when time gets late in the Santa Clara
office, I find a chair and bring and end to my work and read quietly.
I am driving the car, so i need to wait until the others finish their
days too; but I wait inside the green world of trees and the people
who live faster in their shadow.

I bought a re-usable coffee mug as I wandered around on the weekend to
be better with my consumption as I wandered around San Jose. I also
had *The Overstory* alongside me. Eventually, after wandering the
downtown area we found ourselves in a hipster coffee space; and I sat
down with the book for a while. The coffee cup that I had put in the
same bag had leaked. Coffee had stained the bottom edging of the book,
marking it.

The book has me now. It is attached to me as I live in the this
transitory space. The story is also set in the same state, and
sometimes in the same streets I am in. I read it here in its real and
imagined. I read in between moments.

And then I pause. I look about. I look at the sky, I look at the
trees. I stop. I start. I am disconnected and connected as I pass the
next hundred pages and the stories settle from generational stories to
individuals; and into one story in which they start eddying closer
together, to each other.

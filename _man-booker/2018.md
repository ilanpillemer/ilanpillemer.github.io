title: Man Booker 2018 (and me)
layout: page
---
I have decided as part of my new year introspection to read the Man
Booker shortlist before the final award is announced. This gives me
about 3 weeks to read through and reach my opinions and thoughts
before the winner is announced.

At the same time I will be travelling, so the reading will occur in
London, Santa Carla (San Francisco) and Johannesburg (South Africa).

In order to help me form my thoughts and understand the experience of
engaging with these works over the next few weeks, I will be writing
down and editing those words that I have written as I go along. So if
you are interested in travelling this journey with me bookmark this
page and pop in over the next few weeks. I am expecting that I will
construct something that is part review, part travelogue and part
introspective.
